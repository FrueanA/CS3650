## Makefile

Use the provided Makefile ([vector/Makefile](vector/Makefile)) to make (re-)compilation easier:

 - `make` will compile the queue/vector implementation and the unit tests
 - `make test` will compile and run the provided unit tests
 - `make valgrind` will run a memory leak test
 - `make clean` will remove the executable and object files

## More Notes on Vectors

You can find additional implementation notes on vectors in [vector.md](vector.md).
